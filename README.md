# Nodejs-Fibonnaci-Assement

The file to write this method in is fibonacci.js.

The tests that are run and  are located in unitTest/fibonacci.spec.js.

# Requirements
The unitTest/fibonacci.spec.js file should not be modified. If you would like to add your own unit tests, you can add these in a separate file in the unitTest folder.

The package.json file should only be modified in order to add any third-party dependencies required for your solution. The jest and babel versions should not be changed.

Your solution must be compatible with Node.js version 15.5.1.

# Tests
Run **"npm install"** to install all dependencies and then run **"npm run test"** to run the unit tests. These should all pass if your solution has been implemented correctly.
